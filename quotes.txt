Fear kills more dreams than failure ever will.
If you do what you've always done, you'll get what you've always gotten.
When you get tired, learn to rest, not quit.
Life is like a bicycle, to keep your balance, you must keep moving.
You have to be "Odd" to be Number One.
Give up on your dreams and die.
Just keep smiling.
